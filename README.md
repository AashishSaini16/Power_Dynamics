# Power Dynamics: Analyzing Global Electricity Trends and Dependencies

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing and visualizing global electricity data sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The project aims to provide insights into electricity production, imports, exports, and overall energy dynamics across different countries.

### Data Source:
[International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/monthly-electricity-statistics)  
Please refer to the original source for detailed information on data collection and methodology.

### Key Features:

- **Data Cleaning**: Processes and cleans raw energy data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates metrics such as net electricity production, imports, and exports.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Creates interactive time series plots to visualize electricity trends over time.
- **Summary Statistics**: Provides summary statistics and key metrics for in-depth analysis.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares net energy balance and import dependence across countries.
- **Heatmaps and Correlation Analysis**: Generates heatmaps to examine import dependence by country and year, and correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between energy metrics.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Static and interactive visualizations.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations and time series plots.

### Visualizations:

- **Interactive Time Series Plot**: Create time series plots to visualize electricity metrics for each country.
- **Summary Bar Charts**: Generate bar charts to show net energy balance and import dependence by country.
- **Heatmaps**: Produce heatmaps to analyze import dependence and correlations between energy metrics.
